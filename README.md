## Technology Stack

This project uses a modern tech stack to build and manage both the backend and frontend of the AirBnB Clone. Below is a list of key technologies and their roles in the project:

### 1. Django
- **Purpose**: A high-level Python web framework used to build robust, secure, and scalable web applications. It helps in creating RESTful APIs and handling backend logic efficiently.

### 2. PostgreSQL
- **Purpose**: A powerful open-source relational database system used to store and manage application data, such as user profiles, bookings, property listings, and reviews.

### 3. GraphQL
- **Purpose**: An API query language used to efficiently fetch and manipulate data between the frontend and backend, giving clients more control over the data they request.

### 4. HTML & CSS
- **Purpose**: Used to structure and style the frontend of the application, enabling a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.

### 5. JavaScript
- **Purpose**: Adds interactivity to the frontend, allowing dynamic content updates, form validation, and integration with backend APIs.

### 6. Git & GitHub
- **Purpose**: Version control tools that help manage code history, enable collaboration, and allow deployment via repositories.

### 7. Docker (optional)
- **Purpose**: Used to containerize the application, making it easier to deploy and run consistently across different environments.

### 8. Nginx (optional)
- **Purpose**: Acts as a reverse proxy and web server for serving static files and forwarding client requests to backend servers.


## Database Design

The database for the AirBnB Clone is structured to handle core functionalities like user management, property listings, bookings, reviews, and payments. Below are the main entities and their key fields:

### 1. Users
Represents all users of the platform, including guests and hosts.

**Key Fields:**
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: Full name of the user
- `email`: User email (unique)
- `password_hash`: Encrypted password
- `is_host`: Boolean to determine if the user is a host

### 2. Properties
Represents listings available for rent by hosts.

**Key Fields:**
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `user_id`: Foreign key referencing the host (User)
- `title`: Title of the property listing
- `location`: Address or city
- `price_per_night`: Rental price per night

### 3. Bookings
Captures the reservation details made by users for properties.

**Key Fields:**
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `user_id`: Foreign key referencing the guest (User)
- `property_id`: Foreign key referencing the property
- `start_date`: Date when booking starts
- `end_date`: Date when booking ends

### 4. Reviews
Users can leave reviews for properties they've booked.

**Key Fields:**
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `user_id`: Foreign key referencing the reviewer
- `property_id`: Foreign key referencing the reviewed property
- `rating`: Numeric score (e.g., 1 to 5)
- `comment`: Text review

### 5. Payments
Stores payment transactions related to bookings.

**Key Fields:**
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `booking_id`: Foreign key referencing the booking
- `amount`: Total payment amount
- `payment_method`: e.g., credit card, PayPal
- `status`: e.g., successful, pending, failed

---

### Entity Relationships:
- A **User** can have multiple **Properties** (if they are a host).
- A **User** can make multiple **Bookings** (if they are a guest).
- A **Property** can have many **Bookings** and **Reviews**.
- A **Booking** belongs to one **User** and one **Property**.
- A **Review** is written by a **User** for a specific **Property**.
- A **Payment** is tied to a **Booking**.

## Feature Breakdown

The AirBnB Clone project is designed with several core features that mimic the essential functionalities of a real-world rental platform. Each feature plays a critical role in delivering a seamless user experience:

### 1. User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. Users can sign up as either guests or hosts, enabling them to either book properties or list their own properties for rent.

### 2. Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings. This feature ensures that properties are well-described, priced appropriately, and displayed attractively for potential guests.

### 3. Booking System
Guests can search for available properties and make reservations for specific dates. The booking system handles availability, prevents double bookings, and manages the entire reservation lifecycle.

### 4. Review System
Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties they have stayed in. This fosters trust within the community by helping future guests make informed decisions based on previous experiences.

### 5. Payment Processing
Secure payment functionality is integrated to allow guests to pay for their bookings online. This ensures a safe transaction process for both guests and hosts, with support for multiple payment methods.

### 6. Search and Filtering
Users can search properties by location, price range, availability, and other filters. This feature enhances the user experience by helping users quickly find properties that meet their specific needs.

## API Security

Securing the backend APIs is critical to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure the integrity of the platform. The following security measures will be implemented:

### 1. Authentication
Only registered users can access protected endpoints. Authentication (such as JWT tokens or session-based login) verifies the identity of users and ensures that only valid users can perform actions like booking properties or listing rentals.

**Why it matters:** Protects user accounts from unauthorized access and prevents impersonation.

### 2. Authorization
After authentication, authorization ensures users can only perform actions they are permitted to. For example, a guest should not be able to edit another user's property listing, and only hosts can create properties.

**Why it matters:** Protects sensitive data and resources by enforcing user permissions.

### 3. Rate Limiting
Limits the number of API requests a user or IP address can make within a certain time frame. This helps protect the system from abuse, such as brute-force attacks or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

**Why it matters:** Maintains system stability and protects the application from being overwhelmed by excessive or malicious traffic.

### 4. Data Validation and Sanitization
All user inputs will be validated and sanitized to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other forms of attacks.

**Why it matters:** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious code or damaging the database through user input.

### 5. Secure Payment Processing
Sensitive financial transactions will be handled through secure, third-party payment processors, ensuring encrypted communication and protection of user payment information.

**Why it matters:** Builds user trust and ensures compliance with financial data protection standards.

## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes. CI/CD pipelines help ensure that new code integrates smoothly into the main codebase and is automatically tested to catch bugs early.

**Why CI/CD is important for this project:**
- It ensures faster and more reliable development cycles.
- It reduces human error by automating testing and deployment processes.
- It allows for quick and safe updates to the project without disrupting users.
- It improves collaboration among developers by making sure the code is always in a deployable state.

**Tools that could be used:**
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates workflows for testing and deploying the application directly from GitHub.
- **Docker:** Containers can be used to package the application with all its dependencies, making it easier to deploy consistently across different environments.
- **Heroku / AWS / Render:** For hosting and automatic deployment of the app after successful builds and tests.
